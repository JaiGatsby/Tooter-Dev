# Wynaut
My foray into building a text editor. Because Wynaut?

For the initial bit I'll be following Snaptoken's [kilo-tutorial](https://github.com/snaptoken/kilo-tutorial) which is based off of Antirez's [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo)

Further on, I plan to add some bits of functionality. Primary purpose is to learn.
